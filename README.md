FiveM Custom mining script by me
First script created by me from scratch

After deving for a month on a server of messed up and mismatched scripts...I've learn't to do things in a tidy and dynamic way that most don't.

- Highly customisable via config.lua
- Customisable points for mining
  - Add a Location for an ore to the config and it will use this location for both bt-target and a prop
  - Can place them anywhere, doesn't have to be just one mining location
  - I opted for a drilling animation as opposed to the pickaxe swinging

- NPC's spawn on the blip locations
  - These locations can also give third eye and select ones have context menus for selling points

- Features simplistic crafting that doesnt need another system
  - Simple "take this item, give this item" crafting

- Features Stone Cracking bench to fend off to the often used "Throw the rocks in smelter and magically organise ores"
- Features Jewel cutting bench as an attempt to add more than just gold bars and such to sell


Current Dilema:
Currently stumped on the GetItemByName command.
Every time I try to call it, it claims it's a nil value and I can't work out why.

If anyone finds this and can give me a hint please DO. It's killing me being so close to finishing this.

Once that's figured out I can move on to the crafting (which is basically the same system) and its done and ready!
(oh if anyone has any good images for gems/ores, please let me know)
